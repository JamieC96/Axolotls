    <p>Welcome to my website about Axolotls! Axolotls are fascinating creatures that despite spending their whole life in water, are actually amphibians and not fish. I have been keeping and raising axolotls for a few years, and across this site, you will learn all about Axolotls, from keeping them, to how they live in the wild, as well as lots of pictures of these funny critters!
