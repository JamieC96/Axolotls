This project sets out to explain what axolotls are to users, some information on them as a species as well as some information
should they chose to get an axolotl for their own aquariums. 

Alongside information, this project also features videos, pictures in the form of a gallery and the ability to reach out
and request a phone call to discuss axolotls in more detail with myself.
